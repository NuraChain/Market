# AuctionHouse

**Trade on what happens next.**

An open-source prediction market: people buy and sell shares in real-world outcomes, prices read
as probabilities, and markets settle on chain. Bilingual English and Persian, native on mobile
and on desktop.

## What it is

A share in an outcome costs between 0c and 100c, and its price is the market's estimate of the
odds: a share trading at 34c means the market gives that outcome a 34% chance. Buy it, and if the
outcome happens the share settles at 100c.

Trades and settlement happen on chain through a browser wallet. The server owns what a chain
should not: market metadata, uploaded images, and the read models the pages are built from. The
admin console creates, pauses and resolves markets against the deployed contracts.

> **Status:** working software, not yet battle-tested at scale. The contracts have a test suite
> and the money rules below are enforced server-side, but this has not been audited. Run it on a
> testnet before it holds anything you would miss.

## Features

- **Prices that read as odds.** Full-height outcome buttons carry their own price, and one
  convention holds everywhere: 34c means a 34% chance, said in plain words on the market page.
- **English and Persian as equals.** RTL is a first-class layout built on logical properties, with
  Vazirmatn, Persian-Arabic digits, Toman amounts with real scale words, and Jalali dates. The
  second language is native product copy, not a translation gloss.
- **Native on both form factors.** Mobile gets a bottom tab bar, drag-handled sheets, a sticky
  trade bar and 44px targets. Desktop gets hover, density, a sticky trade ticket and keyboard
  paths. One component, two presentations - not a scaled-down desktop.
- **Dark first, light complete.** Two full parallel colour scales flipped by one `data-theme`
  attribute. Light is a first-class theme, never a derived tint.
- **Accessible by construction.** WCAG AA contrast in both themes, visible focus rings, and
  YES/NO that always travel with an icon and a label - never colour alone.
- **Designed empty and error states.** Every empty list carries a next action, and a render that
  throws swaps in a recoverable page instead of a blank screen.
- **Search that works in both languages**, instantly, from either keyboard.
- **On-chain settlement** with an admin console for creating, pausing and resolving markets.

## Quick start

Requires **Node >= 24** and a browser wallet for the trading flows.

```sh
npm install
cp server/.env.example server/.env

npm run chain          # a local EVM node on :8545 (leave it running)
npm run seed           # deploy the contracts and open a few markets
npm run dev            # the app
```

`npm run dev` runs both halves: the API server on **:3000**, vite on **:5173** with `/api`
proxied. Open <http://localhost:5173>.

Point your wallet at the local chain (chain id `31337`, RPC `http://127.0.0.1:8545`) and import
one of the node's funded test accounts to trade. Without `npm run chain` the pages render but
every trade fails - there is nothing to trade against.

## Configuration

Copy `server/.env.example` to `server/.env`. Every key the server reads is listed there; keep the
two files in step.

| Key | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT` | `3000` | Server port |
| `NODE_ENV` | `development` | `production` serves the built client |
| `CLIENT_DIR` | `../application/dist` | Built client, served from the same origin |
| `SSR_ENTRY` | `../application/dist-server/entry.server.js` | SSR bundle |
| `UPLOAD_DIR` | `uploads` | Where market and outcome images are written |

## Deployment

```sh
npm run build
NODE_ENV=production npm start
```

One process serves the API and the built client on one origin, so there is no CORS to configure.
Put a reverse proxy in front for TLS.

In a container - build from the repository root, where the workspace lockfile lives:

```sh
docker build -f server/Dockerfile -t auctionhouse .
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file server/.env -v auctionhouse-uploads:/app/uploads auctionhouse
```

Before running it for real:

- **`UPLOAD_DIR` must survive a deploy.** Market images live on disk, not in the database. Mount a
  volume, or they 404 after the next release.
- **Contract addresses are build-time input.** Re-deploying the contracts means re-exporting the
  ABIs (`npm run contracts:abis`) and rebuilding the client.
- **The admin console is key-gated.** Whoever holds the admin key can resolve markets, which
  decides who gets paid. Treat it as a production credential.

## Architecture

Compiled `.azeroth` components on the client, an `@azerothjs/http` server, and **one typed API
declaration between them** - the browser's client is inferred from the server's own route
declarations, so a handler and its caller cannot drift.

Two rules to know before touching anything:

- **One number module.** Every price, volume, percentage and date renders through
  `application/src/i18n/format.ts`. Persian-digit bugs die in its unit tests, not in production.
- **Tokens are the source of truth for style.** Colour, radius and motion live in
  `application/src/styles/tokens.css`. Components consume tokens; they never invent values.

```

  src/styles/           tokens.css (the Ledger design system), base.css

## Development

| Script | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Server + client, one banner, hot reload on both |
| `npm run check` | Type-check (azeroth-tsc + tsc) and lint, both workspaces |
| `npm test` | Unit and component tests (vitest, happy-dom) |
| `npm run build` | Client bundle + SSR bundle + prerender |
| `npm start` | Run the built app (set `NODE_ENV=production`) |
| `npm run chain` | A local EVM node on :8545 |
| `npm run seed` | Deploy the contracts and open sample markets |
| `npm run contracts:compile` | Compile the Solidity |
| `npm run contracts:test` | The contract test suite |
| `npm run contracts:deploy:local` | Deploy to the running local chain |
| `npm run contracts:abis` | Export ABIs into the client |

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. For anything larger than a fix, open an issue first so the
approach can be agreed before you spend the time.

Before opening a pull request, both gates must pass:

```sh
npm run check
npm test
```

House style is enforced by the linter and visible in any neighbouring file: Allman braces, one
import per module, and comments that state a constraint the code cannot show rather than
narrating what changed.

- **Adding a page:** one row in `application/src/routes.ts` plus its `*.page.azeroth` component.
- **Adding a component:** shared UI goes in `components/ui/` and consumes tokens, never raw values.
- **Adding user-facing copy:** it goes in `src/i18n/en.ts` **and** `src/i18n/fa.ts`. An inline
  string in a component is a review comment.

## Security

**Do not open a public issue for a security bug.** Report it privately to the maintainer so a fix
can ship before the details are public.

The money rules are enforced on the server, not in the UI, and are the right place to start if you
are reviewing:

- The charged amount comes from the stored row, never from the request.
- Settlement is idempotent - a paid position cannot be paid twice.
- A resolved market cannot be resolved again.
- Admin routes are key-gated, and that key decides who gets paid.
